Why has the University of Canberra implemented MFA?,"The University of Canberra has implemented MFA for all student accounts to address the threat of cyber-attack.

With the implementation of MFA for students now complete, the entire University of Canberra user environment is protected, aligning to security best practice and making our systems more secure.",,why has the university of canberra implemented mfa
How does MFA work?,"MFA is the same as being asked to provide two (or more) forms of ID to verify who you are. It’s the principle of providing more than just your password (something you know) which may have been stolen or guessed, by combining it with another factor of proof, such as something you are (biometric) or something you have (like your smartphone).

When logging into your University of Canberra account, you may be prompted to verify your identity via an Authenticator Application (such as Microsoft Authenticator) installed on your smartphone or tablet.

This verification process on your smartphone/tablet is in addition to your username and password on your device that you use to access University applications.

Neither the Microsoft Authentication application or the University will have any access to any personal information (such as bank details, passwords, photos, messages, calls or browsing history) on your smartphone/tablet.",,how does mfa work

If you choose to use an alternate app, be mindful that the University support teams may not have experience with them and may be unable to provide assistance to you.

Please be careful when downloading and using a different authenticator App.  The Microsoft Authenticator App will never ask you for personal information or credit card details.

What is a unit?,"At some universities a unit may be called a subject, at others it may be called a course. A unit is the basic module for teaching and learning at the University of Canberra. Learners study units in a sequence to make up (say) a major sequence, or a minor sequence. They also may take ‘electives’ and together all these will make up their ‘course’ which results in their degree.

Units at the University of Canberra can be at one of three levels:

Level 1 is usually an introductory unit – so if a subject area is new to you a Level 1 unit is a good place to start.

Level 2 units sometimes have pre-requisites or co-requisites. As you are auditing a unit you don’t need to worry about these, but if you don’t have existing knowledge of the subject area it may make it more difficult for you to engage with the unit content.

Level 3 units are those generally undertaken in the third year of a course and assume students have developed a range of skills to support their success in university study. You can also audit post-graduate units. Although these units are offered at the post-graduate level and will assume competency in university study skills, the subject matter may be introductory as some post-graduate courses are designed for people changing careers, up-skilling or re-skilling.",,what is a unit

How can I get an ISBN allocated for my publication?,"

 The Library allocates ISBNs for University publications. To qualify for an ISBN from the University, the publication must have the University imprint and be available for sale or distribution outside the University.

 [ISBN Allocation](http://www.canberra.edu.au/library/teachingstaff/isbn) 
 page.
 



",,how can i get an isbn allocated for my publication
Can I get all my textbooks electronically?,"

**Purchasing ebooks** 




 Many textbooks are available electronically (ebooks) and this may be a cost effective and practical way to purchase your textbook. Ebooks are often sold directly from the publisher's website.
 



 Some courses are using ebooks through the Top Hat service - your lecturer has details on how to purchase these.
 



**Ebooks in the Library** 




 The Library prefers to purchase ebooks when they are available, however some publishers will not sell ebook textbooks to libraries or places them under certain restrictions e.g. short access or download periods, limited number of users at one time.
 



 The Library provides access to over 30,000 ebooks. You can check if your textbook is available in the Library as an ebook by searching the
 [Library Catalogue](https://canberra.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?sortby=rank&vid=61ARL_CNB:61ARL_CNB) 
 .
   

  

 In a search results list, look for an 'Available Online' link under the book details.
 



**Chapters from books** 




 If you are asked to read a chapter from a particular book (not your textbook), check your unit's Canvas site to see if your lecturer has made it available online through the Reading List.
 



",,can i get all my textbooks electronically
Are books peer reviewed or refereed?,"

 The short answer is no, not in the same way journal articles are.
 



 Peer-review essentially means that a written work has been evaluated by people (the author's peers) with knowledge in the same field who have verified the sources and information found within that particular work. With journal articles this is a formalised process and journals promote the fact that their articles have been through this review process.
 



 With books, the process of fact-checking and verifying sources is done by the publisher during publication, and generally not by a panel of peers. It is not a formalised peer-review process.
 



 Most books in the Library's collection are academic or scholarly works appropriate for use by university students, but there are ways you can evaluate the information you find to make sure it is of good quality. This includes: checking the author's credentials and any affiliations with academic institutions or organisations; checking the bibliographies and reference lists; and critically evaluating the text for bias, evidence and relevancy. The Library has a handout about evaluating information sources linked below that might help you analyse the information that you find.

* Seamless integration with the Canvas LMS enabling more efficient workflows for staff and students.
* Enhanced reporting for staff and students.
* Access to a larger number of databases and papers.
* Improved options for feedback, engagement and educating students about plagiarism.
* Provides enhanced analytics to support faculty investigations.
* Used by the Australian Higher Education institutions and in over 1000 educational technology partners and 81 of the top 100 world universities.
* Turnitin has a database consisting of 1.8 billion archived student papers, 99 billion web pages crawled, 89 million scholarly publications as of July 2023.
* Can help detect possible cases of contract cheating.
* The Turnitin Support Center provides answers to student and staff questions via email, live chat, telephone, and self-service methods.







 Turnitin's generated AI content matching feature has not been enabled at UC while it is being evaluated, staff and students will be informed if the University decides to enable this feature in future.
 























 With the move to Turnitin it is important to understand that students retain ownership of the content of their submissions, including their intellectual property. It is also important to understand that Turnitin will not provide or display the content of their submission to any third party.

Are books peer reviewed or refereed?,"

 The short answer is no, not in the same way journal articles are.
 



 Peer-review essentially means that a written work has been evaluated by people (the author's peers) with knowledge in the same field who have verified the sources and information found within that particular work. With journal articles this is a formalised process and journals promote the fact that their articles have been through this review process.
 



 With books, the process of fact-checking and verifying sources is done by the publisher during publication, and generally not by a panel of peers. It is not a formalised peer-review process.
 



 Most books in the Library's collection are academic or scholarly works appropriate for use by university students, but there are ways you can evaluate the information you find to make sure it is of good quality. This includes: checking the author's credentials and any affiliations with academic institutions or organisations; checking the bibliographies and reference lists; and critically evaluating the text for bias, evidence and relevancy. The Library has a handout about evaluating information sources linked below that might help you analyse the information that you find.

How do I extend my CoE?,"If you are an international student who needs to apply for a new student visa to extend your stay onshore to complete your study in Australia, you will need to apply for a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) extension.

steps to apply for a CoE Extension:
-Extend your Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)
Contact your current or an alternate Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) Provider (UC's preferred healthcare provider is Allianz Care Australia - to arrange your OSHC with Allianz Care Australia click here) to obtain a new OSHC policy to match the length of your anticipated visa. If the duration of your new course is less than 10 months, add one extra month to OSHC. If your course is more than 10 months, add two months extra OSHC. If the course is more than 10 months and finishes at the end of the academic year in November/December, OSHC should be provided to 15 March the following year.

can i get a credit transfer?,"If you come to UC with relevant experience, you can gain credit towards your degree. This reduces the number of units you must take to complete your course, meaning you can finish your studies sooner and save money too.

Credit transfer applies to units you've either wholly or partially completed, so long as you studied at a recognised institution such as a registered college or training provider, university or TAFE.

what is a proctored exam?,"Typically, your exams are held on campus and invigilated in person by a UC staff member. Where this cannot be done, e.g., when students are not able to come onto campus because of an ACT Health public health order, the University uses online proctoring to help you continue your studies.  

For an exam to be online proctored you will need to download the Chrome browser, if you don’t already have it on your computer, and an extension to the Chrome browser (browser extension)  to enable recording of your exam-taking (refer to the instructions below).  

At UC online proctoring of your exam is enabled by Proctorio software connected to UC’s UCLearn(Canvas). Proctorio uses your computer’s webcam and microphone when you are completing the exam in your teaching site. It is only able to do this when it is connected to that particular exam.  Proctorio acts as an online invigilator. When Proctorio is used for an exam it records what you are doing and saying through your webcam and microphone and records what internet screens etc you are accessing.  Prior to the exam your Unit Convener will apply settings for determining what Proctorio will flag as a behaviour or activity that may need to be reviewed e.g., unusual movement or loud noises, such as people moving behind you, people talking, accessing internet materials that are not designated as permitted materials etc.  

After the exam the Unit Convener can review a report which identifies behaviours or activities that Proctorio measured against the settings for the exam and highlights for review. The Unit Convener can review the recording of you taking your exam and evaluate whether the behaviour or activity that Proctorio has identified is of any concern.  

Normal activity, such as looking around and looking up or down when thinking is not usually identified by the Proctorio software unless it is very different to the activity of most students taking the same exam. The recording may be reviewed by authorised staff of the University, and if cheating is suspected, it is dealt with in accordance with the UC (Student Conduct Rules) 2018. 

As per the UC (Student Conduct Rules) 2018 cheating is not tolerated by the University. Where it’s not possible to provide alternative assessment, then the use of online proctoring assists in enabling you to continue to progress your studies with minimal disruption, while enabling a process that assists in assuring the academic integrity of the assessment.

When can I defer my exam?,"Applying for a deferral is better than turning up to your exam unwell and having to leave early. This would make you ineligible for special consideration and will affect the progress of your course.
Acceptable reasons for a deferral could include:

I am unwell – If you’re unwell, you’ll need to show you have a signed medical certificate from a doctor, dentist or other qualified health practitioner to be considered for a deferral. The medical certificate should cover the date of your exam. 
There’s been a death in my family – You can apply for a deferral if you've lost a family member or close friend and can provide a death certificate or a letter from your doctor.
I have a sporting commitment – You can apply for a deferral if you're competing in a sport at state or national level. Ask your team manager or another national athletic adviser for a letter to support your request. If you're involved in UC’s Elite Athlete Program, talk to the Elite Athlete or Wellbeing teams about your commitments and availability. 
I have a work commitment – If you have an unavoidable work commitment at the same time as an exam, your employer will need to give you some evidence of this to support your request for a deferral. 
My car has broken down or been in an accident – You need a police or mechanic’s report if you want to defer your exam because of an accident or transport problems. If you’ve been injured in a road accident, ask your doctor, dentist or another health practitioner for a medical certificate. 
I need to attend court – If you’ve been called up for jury duty or need to go to court for another reason, you'll need to show a legal summons or other evidence when you request a deferral. 
I’ve taken three or more exams in a row – If you've exceeded the University’s reasonable exam load of three consecutive exams, you may be eligible to defer one or a few of them.
Other reasons – If you feel you have another legitimate reason to defer an exam, you can explain this in a statutory declaration form. Before you do, keep in mind that deferrals are not given for going to or taking part in a wedding, for international or domestic travel unrelated to your studies, to enable you to attend a social event or due to misunderstanding information about your exam.",,when can i defer my exam

I have a work commitment – If you have an unavoidable work commitment at the same time as an exam, your employer will need to give you some evidence of this to support your request for a deferral. 
My car has broken down or been in an accident – You need a police or mechanic’s report if you want to defer your exam because of an accident or transport problems. If you’ve been injured in a road accident, ask your doctor, dentist or another health practitioner for a medical certificate. 
I need to attend court – If you’ve been called up for jury duty or need to go to court for another reason, you'll need to show a legal summons or other evidence when you request a deferral. 
I’ve taken three or more exams in a row – If you've exceeded the University’s reasonable exam load of three consecutive exams, you may be eligible to defer one or a few of them.
Other reasons – If you feel you have another legitimate reason to defer an exam, you can explain this in a statutory declaration form. Before you do, keep in mind that deferrals are not given for going to or taking part in a wedding, for international or domestic travel unrelated to your studies, to enable you to attend a social event or due to misunderstanding information about your exam.

You can defer an exam being held during an end-of-semester examination period if you're unwell or dealing with another unavoidable problem and can provide supporting documentation. Apply for the deferral before you sit the exam. Leaving early will make you ineligible to apply and will affect your progress in your course.

You can defer a final semester exam but it will postpone your graduation until the following semester.

You can't defer a mid-semester exam or quiz being held outside the exam period. If you'd like to defer these assessments, you'll need to discuss your reasons with your unit convener, whose decision will be final.

You can’t defer an exam that’s already been deferred in line with the University of Canberra’s Assessment Policy and Assessment Procedures, although you can appeal these policies. Outline your situation, including why you had to defer in the first place and why you can’t make the deferred exam.

What is CAN at UC?,"A Commonwealth Assistance Notice (CAN) is provided to all students who are enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place and/or accessing the Government Loan Scheme.

A CAN provides important information about your enrolment, fees and any payments you’ve made, as well as the amount of your HECS-HELP debt, which will be reported to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). You'll receive a new notice for each teaching period you enrol in.

Your CAN should display 28 days after Census date. In it, you’ll find:

the units of study for which you’ve received Commonwealth assistance
the student contribution amounts you’ve been charged for the units you're enrolled in
any upfront payments you’ve made
any HECS-HELP and/or SA-HELP assistance you've used for the teaching period
the balance of your account

A CAN is not an invoice, so there’s no need to contact the ATO if you think there is an error in it. Just let us know if you want to contest your CAN.

If you don’t already have one, you'll need to apply for an Australian Tax File Number (TFN) to defer your tuition fees and Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) to your HELP loan. One of the questions on the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) application form asks whether you have a TFN; if you don't, you'll need to show the Student Centre the receipt the ATO issues you after you’ve applied for a TFN.

Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs)
A Commonwealth Supported Place is a type of enrolment where part of the cost of your units is paid for by the Australian Government. The remaining cost is called a student contribution and you can choose to pay this upfront or defer it to a HECS-HELP loan.

Unless you choose to pay your fees upfront, you’ll repay your HECS-HELP loan through your taxes when you earn more than the repayment threshold set by the Australian Government.

If you’re relying on results from another institution to complete your course at the end of Semester 1 or Winter Term and graduate shortly afterwards, let us know by contacting the Student Centre.

You’ll need to provide us with a copy of your official results from the external institution by the cross-institutional results deadline or wait until the next round of ceremonies to graduate.

How will I know I've met the eligibility requirements?
Once you've met the eligibility requirements we’ll send you an email to confirm that you can graduate. You should receive this email in:
July if you complete your course in Semester 1
August if you complete your course in Winter Term
December if you complete your course in Semester 2
March if you complete your course in Summer Semester.",,what are the steps to confirm that i m prepared to graduate
How do I know if I've completed all necessary criteria for graduation?,"To be eligible to graduate, you will need to have completed the mandatory and other level units that make up your course's requirements. To refresh your knowlede of these units, search for your course and, when you've found it, click on the 'requirements' tab.

You can also track your course and unit progress on the Current study page.
Update your completion period
In order to graduate, your completion period and year must appear correctly in MyUC. If this doesn’t happen by the graduation deadline, we won’t identify you for graduation or course completion. You can update your course completion period, on your Course progress page.
If you experience any issues with updating your course completion period in MyUC, contact the Student Centre immediately and ask to be included in the upcoming graduation round.

If your course completion date is not confirmed in time for the graduation ceremonies held in September/October, we’ll assess you for the graduation ceremonies held in March/April of the following year. The opposite is also true; if you’re due to graduate at the March/April ceremonies and have not confirmed your course completion in time, you’ll need to wait until September/October to graduate.

Advise us if you're graduating with a double degree or subsumable award
If you’re hoping to graduate from one part of a double degree or a subsumable award, let us know by contacting the Student Centre. If the double degree is an unofficial one, include this information when you contact us. Also, make sure you let us know if you’ve already graduated from one part of a double degree and are now ready to graduate from the second part.
